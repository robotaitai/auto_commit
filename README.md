# Auto Code Pusher ðŸš€

Welcome to **Auto Code Pusher** â€“ the project that makes sure your code is always pushing forward, even when you're busy coding (or procrastinating)! This nifty shell script auto-generates some fun code and pushes it to your GitHub repository every 2 hours. It's like having a little robot friend that never forgets to commit.

## What It Does

- **Auto-Generates Code:** Creates a Python file with a fresh timestamp and a friendly greeting.
- **Automates Git Commands:** Adds, commits, and pushes changes to your `main` branch automatically.
- **Scheduled Fun:** Runs every 2 hours via a cron job so that your repository is always up-to-date.

## How It Works

1. **Shell Script Magic:**  
   The `auto_commit.sh` script creates (or updates) a file called `auto_generated.py` with some autogenerated code and the current timestamp.

2. **Git Automation:**  
   It stages any changes, commits them with a timestamped message, and pushes them to GitHub.

3. **Cron Job Scheduling:**  
   The script is set up to run every 2 hours using cron. No manual intervention is needed â€“ your commits will roll in like clockwork!

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
